#' @title easyVerification matrix to climatological grid conversion
#' @description Convert a xyz-type score matrix as returned by \code{veriApply} to a climatological grid
#' @param easyVeri.mat A matrix containing the verification score,
#'  as returned by \code{\link[easyVerification]{veriApply}}
#' @param obs.grid The grid containing the verifying observations used in the call to \code{veryApply}
#'  producing the score matrix.
#' @param verifun Optional. Character string indicating the value of the \code{verifun} value. Just for 
#' a better traceability and metadata completeness. 
#' @return A climatological grid.
#' @seealso \code{\link{climatology}}, \code{\link{plotClimatology}}.
