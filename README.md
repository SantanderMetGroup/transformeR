# What is transformeR
`transformeR` is a R package for climate data manipulation, seamlessly integrated with the [`loadeR` bundle](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR). It allows to easily perform many typical climate data manipulations in a flexible way, including:

* Computing and visualizing climatological maps
* Detrending and application of different time filters
* Interpolation/regridding
* PCA/EOF analysis
* Convenient options for subsetting and aggregation along any object dimension
* Conversion to other convenient formats and bridging functions to other R packages
* And more ...

It also contains several buit-in climate datasets, and provides different internal utilities for the R package [`downscaleR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR) for bias correction and statistical downscaling.
