# What is transformeR?

transformeR is an R package for climate data manipulation and transformation including subsetting, regridding, and data conversion. Find out more about this package at the [transformeR wiki](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/transformeR/wiki). 

This package is part of the [climate4R bundle](http://www.meteo.unican.es/climate4r), formed by `loadeR`, `transformeR`, `downscaleR` and `visualizeR`. The recommended installation procedure is to use the `install_github` command from the devtools R package:

```r
devtools::install_github("SantanderMetGroup/transformeR")
```
**NOTE:** The utilities in transformeR were formerly part of downscaleR (up to v1.3-4). Since downscaleR v2.0-0, these are in transformeR and downscaleR is strictly aimed to statistical downscaling and bias correction.
