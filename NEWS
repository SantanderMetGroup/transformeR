# transformeR changelog

See the [Releases section](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/transformeR/releases) for older version changes

## v1.4.0 (8 Jun 2018)

* New function `intersectGrid`, for calculating spatiotemporal intersections among grids
* Optional flag to skip seasonal check in `scaleGrid`

## v1.4.1 (11 Jun 2018)

* Update built-in data units attribute (for compatibility with udunits parseable strings)
* New helper `getGridUnits` and `setGridUnits`, to handle grid units

## v1.4.2 (21 Jun 2018)

* Minor changes in `makeMultiGrid` (preserves the original input structure when one single grid is given as input, for internal programming convenience). Improved attribute definition.
* Modified behaviour of `getVarNames` to append vertical level in short name definition
* Do nothing (but a warning) when attempting to bind one single grid along member dimension
* Bug fix in `grid2PCs`
* Other minor changes and documentation example updates

## v1.4.3 (19 Jul 2018)

 * Allow for updating the dataset attribute when constructing multimodels via `bindGrid` (enhancement [#18](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/transformeR/issues/18))
 * New helper for checking temporal consistency among grids (`checkTemporalConsistency`)
 * Allow missing data in PCA analysis (enhancement (#13)[https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/transformeR/issues/13])
 * Other minor changes and documentation updates

## v1.4.4 (15 Aug 2018)

 * Allow for binding the loc dimension in `bindGrid` (for point data)
 * Bug fix in `interpGrid` when interpolating from and to point data
 * Other minor changes and documentation updates

## v1.4.5 (21 Sep 2018)
 * Bug fix in temporal consistency check among climatologies
 * Replaced warning by message in `getTemporalResolution`
 
## v1.4.6 (23 Sep 2018)
 * Add new CITATION
 * Edited startup package message
 * Fix typo in on-screen message

## v1.4.7 (17 Dic 2018)
 * Allow calls to bindGrid.member for just one grid without error (a message is given instead)
 * Allow attempts of temporal consistency check with just one grid (with message)
 * Change the order of priority of the dimensions in aggregateGrid for efficiency.
 * Bug fix in bindGrid.spatial for the correct heritage of the latitude values in $xyCoords 
 
## v1.4.8 (16 Apr 2019)
 * New helper function checkGrid to check if date and member information is correct.
 * Bug fix in bindGrid related to the "loc" dimension in irregular grids
 * Other minor changes and documentation updates

## v1.5.0 (24 Jun 2019)
 * New addition to PCA, allowing for rotated EOF analysis
 * New helper function `limitArea` to get grid bounding box
