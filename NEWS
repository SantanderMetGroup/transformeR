transformeR 1.1.2
=================

* Bug fix in `subsetSeason` (exit with message when attempting to aggregate already annual grids)
* Bug fix in `makeMultigrid` attribute retrieval from input grids
* Changed the variable naming convention when multigrids are created. Now the vertical level (when defined) is appended to the name of the variable, following the definition  `"var@@level"`. 
* Other minor documentation updates
