transformeR 1.3.0
=================

* Deprecated `plotClimatology` --> replaced by `visualizeR::spatialPlot`
* Minor internal change in output attributes after subsetting (if resulting 'time' dimension is a singleton the output is considered a climatology)
* Enhanced functionality of interpGrid to allow for transparent interpolation of rotated coordinates 
* New functions: 
   * `gridArithmetics` to perform basic arithmetical operations between multiple grids and/or numbers
   * `bindGrid.lat` to bind grids along the latitude dimension.
   * `overGrid` for spatial overlay operations between climate4R grids and SpatialPolygon* objects
   * `intersectGrid.time` to subset the time dimension of multiple grids by their common dates
   * New internal helper `isGrid` 
* Other minor enhancements and doc updates
