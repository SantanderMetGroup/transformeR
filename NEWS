## 2.0.0 (22 May 2020)

This release of transformeR does not ensure backwards compatibility. Some deprecated functions have been finally removed, and some other moved to visualizeR. Please note that running most of the documentation examples will require from now on to install the new package climate4R.datasets, containing all the climate4R example datasets. The main benefit is that transformeR is now a lightweight package.

 * Built-in datasets have been moved to the new package climate4R.datasets
 * `plotClimatology` no longer exists
 * `plotEOF` moved to visualizeR (to be defunct)
 * Updated examples
 * Exports EOF2clim (formerly an internal), for the spatial representation of EOFs via visualizeR::spatialPlot
 * New helper `fillGridDates` for filling dataset missing dates
 * Other minor bug fixes, documentation updates and enhancements

## 2.0.1 (04 Jun 2020)
 * Removed draw.world.lines internal utility and associated vector layer (moved to visualizeR)
 * Removed dependency from 'raster' (grid2mopa moved to mopa pkg)
 * Added 'simulate' parameter in `binaryGrid` function
 * Force nearest-neighbour application among non-overlapping domains in `interpGrid`
 * Other minor documentation updates

## 2.1.0 (17 Mar 2021)
 * Implementation of Lamb Weather Typing for southern hemisphere
 * Inclusion of type 27 (unclassified) in Lamb WT
 * New functionality for spatial aggregation of rectangular domains
 * Bug fix in partially masked latitudinal weighted domain averages.
 * New option to use masking in interpGrid
 * Bug fix in subsetVar attributes
 * Internal flag in bindGrid.member to skip temporal checks
 * Other minor changes and documentation updates

## 2.1.1 (31 May 2021)
 * New dateutils-family helper functions for consistent date-time class handling (including time-zone defs)
 * Consistent treatment of multiple time resolutions in fillGridDates
