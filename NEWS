transformeR 1.2.0
=================

* New helper functions (mainly for downscaling):
    * `convert2bin`, for binary grid calculation based on user-defined thresholds
    * `dataSplit`, for dataset folding along time dimension
    * `filterNA`, for missing value removal
* Changed the variable naming convention when multigrids are created. Now the vertical level (when defined) is appended to the name of the variable, following the definition  `"var@@level"`.

Other minor bug fixes and changes:

* Bug fix in `subsetSeason` (exit with message when attempting to aggregate already annual grids)
* Bug fix in `makeMultigrid` attribute retrieval from input grids
* Renamed precipitation dataset suffixes (tp --> pr)
* Several documentation updates
