\title{Grid binding by member dimension}
\usage{
bindGrid.member(..., tol, attr.)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Input grids to bind by their member dimension. These must be compatible in time and space (see details).
For flexibility, they can be introduced as a list or directly as consecutive arguments.}

\item{tol}{numeric. Coordinate differences smaller than \code{spatial.tolerance} will be considered equal 
coordinates. Default to 0.001 --assuming that degrees are being used it seems a reasonable rounding error after interpolation--.
This value is passed to the \code{\link{identical}} function to check for spatial consistency of the input grids.}

\item{attr.}{Character string used to update the \code{"dataset"} attribute of the output grid. This
is used only when binding grids along the \code{"member"} dimension, in case multi-model combination is being undertaken,
(i.e., different models are being joined as members of a single multimodel dataset)
so the new dataset attribute reflects this. Note that the default behaviour is retaining the \code{"dataset"} 
attribute of the first grid given, resulting in a misleading metadata information if this is the case. Default to \code{NULL},
and ignored.}
}
\description{
Flexible binding of (spatiotemporally consistent) grids by their member dimension
 useful to handle sets of predictors as a single block.
