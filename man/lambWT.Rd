\title{Calculation of Lamb Weather types (WT).}
\usage{
lambWT(grid, center.point = c(-5, 55), typeU = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{grid}{A grid (gridded or station dataset), or multimember grid object of MSLP values.}

\item{center.point}{A two value vector that must include lon and lat from a location that will work as center point for the Lamb WT.
See details.}

\item{typeU}{Logical. Should "Unclassified" type be included in the output. Default to \code{FALSE}, so the closest is assigned.}
}
\value{
The Lamb WT circulation index (and members, if applicable) with:
\itemize{
\item index: vector with the corresponding weather type from each point of the series, that is defined as follows:

\description{
Calculate automated Lamb WT as defined in Trigo and daCamara (2000), Int J Climatol
}
\details{
According to Trigo and daCamara (2000), Int J Climatol, Lamb WT is only applied on North Atlantic domain. 
The input grid units must be Pa, not hPa/mbar. If it is not in Pa, the units must be converted.
A center location point must be specified by the user. Then, the function calculates from left to right and from first to 16st 
the rest of the location point from the grid specified by Trigo and daCamara (2000):

where the north-south distance is 5ยบ and the west-east distance is 10ยบ. 26 different WTs are defined, 10 pure types (NE, E, SE, S, SW, 
W, NW, N, C and A) and 16 hybrid types (8 for each C and A hybrid).
